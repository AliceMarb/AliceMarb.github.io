            Right now, he's blocking the aisles in trader Joe's picking up the food and checking every label<br/>
            Right now, he's waiting six hours till he lets me put any dairy on the table,<br/>
            Right now, he's pulling out a light box just to check my lettuce for bugs and little insects,<br/>
            I can't object, but
            </p>
           
            <p>
            It truly puts me at a loss to be <br/>
            Dealing with this meshugas,<br/>
            He never wants to eat up my baked treats,<br/>
            He heard at Sinai Moses say  <br/>
            That he won't accept tablet k <br/>
            Maybe next time he'll think before he eats <br/>
            </p>
            
            <p>
            Right now, he's probably pulling out a<br/>
            Torah just to read vayikra and dvarim,<br/>
            Right now, he's probably saying “that's treif”,<br/>
            And I'm a thinking that it's getting extreme,<br/>
            Right now, he's probably surfing on<br/>
            chabad.org to find proper hechshers,<br/>
            I can't stand his lectures, oh…<br/>
            </p>

            <p>
            I sure won't the question the divine<br/>
            But I'm telling you this guest of mine<br/>
            Is making me regret we'd ever meet<br/>
            To feed this member of the tribe,<br/>
            Drives me mad I can't describe,<br/>
            Maybe next time he'll think before he eats<br/>
            </p>

            <p>
            I might have saved a little chullent for his next host,<br/>
            Cause the next time that he eats <br/>
            It won't be by me<br/>
            Oh no, not by me<br/>
            </p>

            <p>
            Through mezonot and shehakol<br/>
            He always seems to know it all <br/>
            From artichoke to all the kosher meats <br/>
            It started with a milk and kid,<br/>
            But so much more do we forbid<br/>
            Maybe next time he'll think before he eats<br/>
            </p>
           
            <p>
            Maybe next time he'll think before he eats
            </p>
